The Twitch streamer [[https://twitch.tv/forsen][Forsen]] has a unique relationship with his audience. He has
built his community around memes and trolling. His fans themselves have gained
popularity as they practice stream sniping in multiplayer games --- some have
risen to become streamers themselves. His community became known for playing
loud music in-game and hunting him down, no matter the cost. As demonstrated,
his fans are the most dedicated out of many other streamers.

Of course, no matter what multiplayer game he plays, he will meet some stream
snipers. A recent clip showed him setting up a room of /What the Dub?!/, a party
game, perfect for his stream snipers. However, what you will see in this clip is
very interesting.

* Stream Sniper Hacks into Forsen's Game

Many of Forsen's chatters were also surprised by a stream sniper abruptly
joining the game without the code. While some have jokingly stated that the
sniper was "living in his walls", some have suggested that he was hacked, which
was most likely the case.

Forsen: How are you in? What? I haven't even posted the code! Alright.

Forsen remains confused for the next two minutes, and so does his audience. Many
people have no idea how the stream sniper has joined. Some people became worried
about a rootkit installed on his computer. A rootkit permits an attacker
administrative access on their victim's computer. It is entirely possible that
Forsen has a rootkit on his computer.

However, some people on a "Forsencord" chat room have revealed something
entirely shocking:

A fan has apparently keylogged Forsen and hacked the code to join his game. A
keylogger tracks everything you type on your computer. Keyloggers can be very
dangerous as people can steal your confidential information.  They exist all
over the internet, and as Forsen always clicks random links from his fans, it's
no surprise that he likely has one. Since a fan has hacked Forsen with a
keylogger, everytime Forsen creates a room, all of the codes will be leaked.

This is not the first time that Forsen could have been hacked, however. In one
instance, he was seen chatting in xQc's chatroom, although he denied it was him.
It's possible his Twitch account was hacked.
