In the video gaming community, ForsenLevel is the new meme that has popped in
Twitch. It originated in the CS:GO Twitch channel "Forsen" which has 1.6 million

leveled up in the game /Counter-Strike: Global Offensive/. His watched him play
CS:GO and say "Forsen Level" every time he leveled up in FACEIT matchmaking.
