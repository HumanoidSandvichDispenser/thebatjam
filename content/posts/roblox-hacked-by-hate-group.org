[[https://roblox.com][Roblox]], a popular online gaming platform
 was recently attacked by a hate group and had many confidential 
documents leaked. 

* How was Roblox Hacked?

It has been revealed that a Roblox employee had their personal computer
compromised through a type of malware called a RAT (Remove Administration Tool).
Which gives the attacker full access over the computer.

* Who were the Hackers?

The group behind this attack was allegedly a company hired by Roblox to test for
security vulnerabilities. The exact motives behind this attack is unknown but
it can be assumed within reason that the hackers were racist.

The leak was revealed on [[https://breached.to/Thread-Roblox-June-2022-documents-leak][online forums in the Dark Web]] where criminal activity
is rampant. Racism, sexism, and homophobia is also quite common on these sites.

* What was Leaked? 

The leak included the earnings of various Roblox influencers, documents
regarding  Terms of Service (ToS), and the cash earned by games on Roblox. The
most controversial  leak was the identities of people who signed up for voice
communication.

Many of these people who had their identities leaked were PoC (People of Color)
and  women, further proof of the racist and sexist motives of the hackers. Also,
many of  the leaked documents also contained many slurs and offensive
terminology.

* What Does this Mean for Roblox? 

With this leak Roblox will likely be much more careful and strict with its
policies.  This is also another omen to the rapidly booming cybersecurity
industry where advanced  security techniques such as blockchain is being used to
prevent Hackers from gaining access  to confidential documents.
