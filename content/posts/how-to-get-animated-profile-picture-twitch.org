If you've ever been on a Twitch channel, there are secret features like the
"GreyFace easter egg" and the "Artifact games directory". What if I told you
there was a way to get animated profile pictures on Twitch? Here we will show
you how you can get animated profile pictures on Twitch.

* What does the Animated Profile Picture Look Like?

An animated profile picture looks like a GIF in place of a regular profile
