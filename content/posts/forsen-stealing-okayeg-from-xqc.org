The Twitch streaming experience is all about finding new favorite broadcasters,
while also engaging with them through chat. For that reason, a streamerâ€™s
personality has become an important aspect of their popularity among viewers.

Readers might be asking: What does personality have to do with anything? Well,
some streamers set themselves apart from others by creating unique impressions
and personas. Forsen, for instance, has gained popularity for his unique
community and fanbase.

Forsen is a streamer who is known to be responsible for many Twitch memes.
However, he is also notorious for stealing several memes, and this is apparently
one of them. Forsen's community is built around spamming memes in the chat room.

But just lately this week, the Swedish streamer Sebastian "Forsen" Fors has been
recently accused of stealing /Okayeg/ from Canadian streamer Felix "xQc"
Lengyel.

Earlier on July 24, [[https://twitter.com/xQcUpdates/status/1551156366881980416][@xQcUpdates tweeted]]:

* What is Okayeg?

[[/img/Okayeg.png]]

Okayeg is a picture of a crudely drawn Pepe the Frog smiling. It is most
commonly used as a reaction image macro in Twitch chats and 4chan. The exact
origin and meaning of this image is unknown, but it has recently become a meme
in xQc's chat and possibly turned into an NFT owned by the Canadian streamer.

* What is FFZ?

FrankerFaceZ (or FFZ for short) is a third party app that enables users to post
and see images on Twitch chat. You can post pictures and reactions onto chat by
inputting keywords. FFZ is available on both Chrome and Firefox.

Users can upload their own images to use in Twitch chat using FFZ, which can
help retain a streamer's audience. Check out [[/posts/5-best-and-5-worst-twitch-emoticons/][our guide to what the best emotes
are]].

* Forsen accused of stealing

Forsen has been accused by many of xQc's fans of stealing the Okayeg NFT. He may
have possibly duplicated the NFT and added it to his own Twitch channel, or he
could have used the meme in his own channel when he is not the owner of the NFT
meme.

This is not the first time the Swede has been accused of stealing from xQc. He
was previously known for "stealing xQc's memes" or using internet memes that
have originated in xQc's Twitch channel:

- Batchest
- Pepelaugh
- He does not know
- pepega
- omegalul
- zulu

One Twitter user has found out that [[https://twitter.com/harry_ruttharry/status/1551210298123616256?s=20&t=ivIPiL2GG8sg2M4ZywEhKQ][Forsen stole this new NFT from xQc]]:

This drama between both streamers still continues, and fans are concerned about
the situation. However, Forsen has yet to mention anything related to this drama
or incident.

* Why Forsen may have copied xQc's Okayeg

There are a few reasons for possibly copying xQcâ€™s NFT. There is an established
market for meme NFTs/images. As such, streamers often create unique image memes
for their channels. Forsen may have copied xQcâ€™s stream art as a way of
strengthening his brand and showcasing his personality to viewers. This will
likely increase the number of impressions and views that Forsenâ€™s stream gets.
In doing so, he will also be able to increase his revenue and make more money
from ad revenue and subscriptions.

* What will happen to Forsen?

As weâ€™ve explored, the Okayeg NFT has become a meme. Itâ€™s also become synonymous
with xQc as he has been using it excluseively. However, Forsen is now using the
same image as xQc's. This means that Forsenâ€™s image has become synonymous with
xQc. Itâ€™s an interesting transition given that xQc is already a streamer who has
a strong and popular personality online. This transition may also mark a shift
in Forsenâ€™s strategy to engage with his viewers. While the Okayeg NFT is silly
and fun, it doesnâ€™t really reflect Forsenâ€™s personality.

Despite Forsen's lack of attention to this issue, people have been outraged at
his actions. It is currently unknown whether or not Forsen will receive some
sort of punishment, such as a ban from Twitch. What is most likely to happen is
that Forsen will remove the Okayeg meme NFT from this chatroom and recognize xQc
as the sole owner of Okayeg.
