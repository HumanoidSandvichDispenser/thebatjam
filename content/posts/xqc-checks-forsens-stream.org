* Why is xQc watching Forsen?

No one knows as to why xQc suddenly pulled up Forsen's stream, but fans have
suggseted that they are in love. Fans speculated this makes sense as Forsen may
have left his previous partner, Nani Heichou, who is presumed to be dead. This
may be speculation or may be an inside joke among the omegalul poggers
community.

To be fair though, in the moment, he might have actually like... like hit...
like a rib or a nerve or something hard, and then it was just like... ah!

Then the Canadian streamer replied with:

Are my takes like that bad?
