In the wake of the recent controversy surrounding popular Twitch streamer
Atrioc, who was discovered to possess deepfake pornography of fellow streamers,
the gaming community has been abuzz with discussions on privacy, boundaries,
and the nature of online relationships. Fellow Twitch personality
[Forsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen) (Sebastian Fors) has shared his
thoughts on the matter, shedding light on his perspective in a recent stream.

Forsen, known for his candid and straightforward approach, addressed the
situation by emphasizing the distinction between personal and professional
boundaries in the world of online content creation. He began by stating:

>"I am not a woman. I can not speak for women obviously, but obviously if
people deepfake me, I wouldn't care if people watch that. Because, y'know, it's
not me. I don't know how else to put it."

The streamer expressed a clear indifference to the idea of deepfakes involving
himself, emphasizing the disconnection between the virtual representation and
his true identity.

>"I can't really understand the perspective of... 'I already did that.' Yeah,
I know you already did that. It's disgusting, but I have to watch you, y'know,
I'm not even going to bring it up. But I don't even care what you do in
private. Like just don't fing tell me about what the f you do. I don't know."

Forsen's comments highlight a nuanced view on privacy, where he asserts that
individuals should be entitled to their personal lives without feeling
obligated to disclose private matters to the public, even within the context of
an online streaming community.

Regarding the argument that Twitch streamers are considered coworkers due to
their shared platform, Forsen countered:

>"I don't think Twitch streamers are your coworkers. You are not employed by
the same company. You're independent contractors. You're not coworkers."

This distinction draws attention to the unique nature of the relationships
formed in the online content creation sphere, challenging conventional notions
of professional camaraderie.

In response to concerns about personal relationships between streamers, Forsen
addressed the fact that Atrioc knows the individuals personally, stating,

>"Oh, they live together? Oh, he knows them personally? Okay, okay."

This acknowledgment underscores the complexity of interpersonal dynamics within
the streaming community, where the lines between professional and personal
relationships can become blurred.
