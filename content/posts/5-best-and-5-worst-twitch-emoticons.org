Twitch emoticons are what define Twitch itself. If you have ever been to a
livestream on Twitch, you may have seen a chatroom with chatters posting images.
These are called emotes.

An emote is basically an emoji on Twitch. They're small images used in chatting
to express a wide range of emotions. For example, the "PogBones" emote is always
used to express that something pog happened on the stream. The "KEKHeim" emote
is always used to express laughter, as "KEK" is what happens when you attempt to
type "–õ–£–õ" (Latin: LUL, also a Twitch emoji) on a standard US keyboard.

Emotes can be used to accompany the chatter's message. Any Twitch emote can add
flair to any message you send.

Here are the five best and five worst emojis on Twitch.tv:

* Best: KonCha

What's the best way to greet a streamer or a new chatter? The answer is always
KonCha. üëã

While other emotes like /HeyGuys/ and the smiley face exist, KonCha is a cuter
way of greeting someone. Twitch does not have that many cute emotes, and most of
them are low resolution images that barely get used. KonCha is unique compared
to many other emotes.

Generally, whenever you want to greet someone, stick with KonCha. It will
provide them a warm, friendlier welcome to the stream.

* Worst: PrimeRlyTho

I hate f*cking airplanes. RlyTho? That just made no sense. ü§®

#+end_export

The emote's primary use is to express disbelief or confusion at a streamer's
actions. There are other emotes that exist for that purpose, such as /cmonBruh/.
While this guy is just sitting there raising his eyebrow. The worst part is not
the lack of emotion, but the fact that it's behind a paywall! üí∏

If you want to express a weak emotion, then go for this emoticon... if you have
the money. This emote requires a Prime subscription to unlock. Otherwise just
stick with /cmonBruh/.

* Best: BTTV Emotes

You know those cheap offbrand chargers you buy because you don't want to pay $60
for a new charger for your iPhone? This is basically what this "BTTV" craze is
all about.

BTTV is a third party app to show emotes on Twitch. You can download and unlock
more emoticons on BTTV. These are not official Twitch emotes, and users can
upload and download any emoticon they want. üíø

Many emoticons on BBTV are popular, including:

** Pag-Man

This is a combination of /Poggers/ and /Pac-Man/.

** Hahaa

This is an emote with an awkward face to convey awkward laughter.

** CvHazmat

This is an emote depicting a yellow /Among Us/ suit. Place emotes before it to
make it a crewmate.

* Worst: BTTV Emotes

BTTV is a third party app to show emotes on Twitch. Like how there are good
emotes on BTTV, there are also bad ones.

** SourPls

Many people use this emote to troll and lag chatrooms; please disable this emote
immediately if you are an owner of a Twitch channel.

** FeelsGoodMan

This is a Pepe the Frog emote. Pepe is considered a dead (and racist after [[https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/pepe-the-frog][being
appropriated by the alt-right]]) meme. It has become a boring emoji to post in
chatrooms.

* Best: PogBones

If you've heard of /Poggers/ and /PogChamp/, you know fans of these emotes are
divided. Some absolutely love /Poggers/ and hate /PogChamp/, while others
absolutely love /PogChamp/ and hate /Poggers/. However, a new contestant rises.

#+end_export

PogBones is an emoji that you can use the exact way as poggers/pog/pogchamp/etc.
This emote is a replacement for any pogger emotes. It looks exactly the same as
Poggers, and it is an official emote, so no need to worry about installing a
third party app on your computer.

It is a poggers-fishbones hybrid from the TV series üì∫ /Arcane/ by Riot Games.
This emote came out with three other /Arcane/ emoticons. If you are a fan of the
show or don't want to install third party services, you may prefer this emote
over other pog emotes.

* Worst: BatChest

Someone just wants to collect fat Pokimane NFTs. BatChest! Someone just wants to
talk about their favorite anime with funny, silly children characters.
BatChest! ü§ì

#+end_export

BatChest is an emote used to depict nerds. Anything nerdy will have the chat use
the BatChest emote.

Some people will find this emote toxic and annoying. In addition, BatChest is a
useless emote; there are several other emotes that can be used to depict
nerdiness, such as the nerd emoji.

* Best: InuyoFace

Streamers are not perfect, of course. That's why we watch them. And sometimes
they fail but in a hilarious fashion. üòÖüòÖ

#+begin_export html

<img src="https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v2/160396/static/light/3.0" width="112">
</center>
#+end_export

InuyoFace is an emoji that you can tell the streamer "in your face!" It is a
funny emote you can use when your streamer does a fail. üíÄ

No matter what channel you use this in, InuyoFace will be a perfect emote to
post onto the chatroom to have fun with your streamer. If you are a streamer,
encouraging the use of this emote will increase interaction with your audience.

* Worst: DansGaming

Is the chat lagging or is the streamer offline? DansGame moment, I know right?

#+begin_export html
<center>
<img src="https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v2/33/static/light/3.0" width="112">
</center>
#+end_export

The DansGame emote is pixeleted and usually used to express disgust. It is
always used in a negative context, no matter the situation. This wide range of
uses led to the overuse of the emote and promotes toxicity. In addition, the
emote is very low quality and pixelated.

In most cases, the emote inhibits negative behavior in the chatroom. It is
recommended that you ban this emote from your chat room if you want to keep
‚ú®positive vibes only‚ú® and troll-free.

* Best: :)

Does this really need an explanation? ü§î

#+begin_export html

<img src="https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v2/1/static/light/3.0" width="112">
</center>
#+end_export

This classic Twitch emote is a smiley face emoticon. You type it with the
classic ":)" emoticon from the old internet ages.

You can use this to be friendly with other chatters. It doesn't hurt to say a
"hello :)" in the chat!

* Worst: LUL

Everyone knows that one person who laughs at everything, even if it's not funny.
This emoji is the embodiment of that. ü§£

#+begin_export html
<center>
<img src="https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v2/425618/static/light/3.0" width="112">
</center>
#+end_export

The emote is used to express laughter, of course, but it gets used for
everything. However, this emote is also basically useless, since other emoticons
such as /4Head/ have overshadowed the purpose of the LUL emoticon.

You can use this emote if you want, but remember that there are much better
alternative choices out there, especially in the large world of Twitch with tons
of emojis.
