Livestreaming has become quite popular on the world wide web and is becoming a viable 
form of media to expand your business and grow your customer base. This guide will show 
all the steps necessary to become a proper live broadcaster. 

The first form of livestreaming occured in 1995 when RealNetworks developed a media player capable of 
livestreaming. The first public live stream was a broadcast of a baseball game between the New York Yankees and 
the Seattle Mariners and was a minor success. 

Livestreaming has expanded rapidly since then with the creation of sites 
such as Chatturbate. However, it was YouTube that truly blew up the live streaming industry. 

In 2008, [[https://YouTube.com][YouTube]] hosted its first live event, named YouTube Live. It was live streamed from San Francisco and Tokyo
at the same time and featured interviews and performances from superstars like Katy Perry, Smosh, MythBusters, and Bo Burnham.

 Although the live event was considered successful, something was still off. YouTube didnâ€™t become a specialized live streaming platform,
 hosting only occasional live broadcasts here and there. The most notable ones were a U2 concert in 2009 and a live Q&A session with Barack Obama in 2010.
 Shortly afterward, the company started the development of its own live streaming technology.


* The Rise of Twitch

Originally known as Justin.tv, [[twitch.tv][Twitch]] is now the most popular platform for online real-time broadcasters. Most of the streams
on Twitch consist of In-Real-Life (IRL) interactions where streamers show their daily lives with very little editting.

This is particularly entertaining to watch because since it is live, all the interactions occur at the same time you are watching it.
This allows for a more exciting watch as what happens next is unknown. This has lead to many hilarious moments that keep viewers watching.

For example, the broadcasting conglomerate One-True-King (OTK) features many In-Real-Life (IRL) live broadcasters that entertain viewers
through goofy stunts and esoteric jokes that only the most loyal of fans will understand. 

* How to Livestream?

Livestreaming can be a very fulfilling way to spread your joy with other people all across the world. In order to livestream a proper
stream setup will be needed to ensure a smooth watching experience. It can be a complex process that will take a significant time investment 
in order to become proficient.
