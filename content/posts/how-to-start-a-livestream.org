Livestreaming has become quite popular on the world wide web and is becoming a viable 
form of media to expand your business and grow your customer base. This guide will show 
all the steps necessary to become a proper live broadcaster. 

It can perhaps be said that the grandfather of livestreaming is television, as it offers
a live broadcast to an audience. However, live streaming is different as it exists on the 
internet and features exclusively live content. 

The first form of livestreaming occured in 1995 when RealNetworks developed a media player capable of 
livestreaming. The first public live stream was a broadcast of a baseball game between the New York Yankees and 
the Seattle Mariners and was a minor success. 

Livestreaming has expanded rapidly since then with the creation of sites 
such as Chatturbate. However, it was YouTube that truly blew up the live streaming industry. 

In 2008, [[https://YouTube.com][YouTube]] hosted its first live event, named YouTube Live. 
Since then, YouTube Live has become a popular platform with many famous people such as 
Sykkunno, who is known for his GTA livestreams and feminine demeanor.  

Even though it was a moderate success YouTube Live failed to gain much popularity. Popular 
Twitch streamer Felix Lengyel (xQc) explained that YouTube lacked the interaction that Twitch 
offered. 

* The Rise of Twitch

Originally known as Justin.tv, [[twitch.tv][Twitch]] is now the most popular platform for online real-time broadcasters. Most of the streams
on Twitch consist of In-Real-Life (IRL) interactions where streamers show their daily lives with very little editting.

This is particularly entertaining to watch because since it is live, all the interactions occur at the same time you are watching it.
This allows for a more exciting watch as what happens next is unknown. This has lead to many hilarious moments that keep viewers watching.

For example, the broadcasting conglomerate One-True-King (OTK) features many In-Real-Life (IRL) live broadcasters that entertain viewers
through goofy stunts and esoteric jokes that only the most loyal of fans will understand. 

* How to Livestream?

Livestreaming can be a very fulfilling way to spread your joy with other people all across the world. In order to livestream a proper
stream setup will be needed to ensure a smooth watching experience. It can be a complex process that will take a significant time investment 
in order to become proficient.
