Livestreaming has become quite popular on the world wide web and is becoming a
viable  form of media to expand your business and grow your customer base. This
guide will show  all the steps necessary to become a proper live broadcaster.

It can perhaps be said that the grandfather of livestreaming is television, as
it offers a live broadcast to an audience. However, live streaming is different
as it exists on the  internet and features exclusively live content.

The first form of livestreaming occured in 1995 when RealNetworks developed a
media player capable of  livestreaming. The first public live stream was a
broadcast of a baseball game between the New York Yankees and  the Seattle
Mariners and was a minor success.

Livestreaming has expanded rapidly since then with the creation of sites  such
as Chatturbate. However, it was YouTube that truly blew up the live streaming
industry.

In 2008, [[https://YouTube.com][YouTube]] hosted its first live event, named YouTube Live.  Since then,
YouTube Live has become a popular platform with many famous people such as
Sykkunno, who is known for his GTA livestreams and feminine demeanor.

Even though it was a moderate success YouTube Live failed to gain much
popularity. Popular  Twitch streamer Felix Lengyel (xQc) explained that YouTube
lacked the interaction that Twitch  offered.

* The Rise of Twitch

Originally known as Justin.tv, [[twitch.tv][Twitch]] is now the most popular platform for
online real-time broadcasters. Most of the streams on Twitch consist of
In-Real-Life (IRL) interactions where streamers show their daily lives with very
little editting.

This is particularly entertaining to watch because since it is live, all the
interactions occur at the same time you are watching it.  This allows for a more
exciting watch as what happens next is unknown. This has lead to many hilarious
moments that keep viewers watching.

For example, the broadcasting conglomerate One-True-King (OTK) features many
In-Real-Life (IRL) live broadcasters that entertain viewers through goofy stunts
and esoteric jokes that only the most loyal of fans will understand.

* How to Livestream?

Livestreaming can be a very fulfilling way to spread your joy with other people
all across the world. In order to livestream a proper stream setup will be
needed to ensure a smooth watching experience. It can be a complex process that
will take a significant time investment in order to become proficient.

Like with many other skills, livestreaming requires time and effort and is not
an easy task, but it will soon pay off in the long run. There are several ways
you can start a livestream. In this tutorial, we will go over the easiest way to
start a livestream.

* Finding Your Streamer Name

Every streamer has a pseudonym to go by. For example, Slots streamer Felix
Lengyel goes by "xQc" and the 1993-94 video games champion Dr. Disrespect goes
by "the two-time".

Use this nickname generator to help find your streamer name.

* Creating a Twitch Account

In order to start livestreaming, you must create a Twitch account. Head to
[[Twitch.tv]] and click "Sign Up" on the top right. You must fill out all the
required fields.

For the username, you use the streamer name that you have come up with. /Use the
username generator provided above if you don't have a streamer name yet./ Once
you create an account, you are now in the world of Twitch! You can watch other
people's livestreams or start creating your own, which we will do in this
tutorial.

This Twitch account will be used for livestreaming. You should make sure this
account is kept secure with a strong password to reduce the chance that it will
be compromised. If you lose your Twitch account, you will lose access to
streaming and all of your followers as well.

After we have created our Twitch livestreaming account, we must install
broadcasting software. For this tutorial, we will be using OBS Studio.

* Installing OBS Studio

OBS Studio is a free and source program you can download to start your
livestream. All you need is a computer that can download and install software.

Studio.

* Set up OBS Studio

In order to get video working on OBS Studio, you must create a /Scene/. A Scene
is a collection of /Sources/ which will display content onto the Scene. Create a
new Scene and add a new Source to it. This Source should be a Game Capture
source if you are streaming a video game, or a Desktop capture if you are
reacting to content.

When you have finished your Scene, check your settings for bitrate, etc. These
affect the quality of your stream. The higher your bitrate is, the higher the
quality your stream is, which will attract more viewers.

You can set your stream FPS so viewers get the smoothest experience, especially
on react content. Try to set this to at least 120 to make your stream look
faster.

* Get Your Stream Key

Your stream key allows OBS to stream to Twitch servers. In order to stream, you
need a stream key. You can retrieve a stream key free of charge by Twitch. Click
[[https://link.twitch.tv/myChannelSettings][here]] to retrieve your stream key.

Go to the stream tab on the left, and you will see your stream key. Please keep
your stream key confidential and store it in a text file in case you lose it.
Stream keys are like passwords; only you should have access to them.

Now you should copy your stream key and open the "Notepad" application or
equivalent on your computer. After it has opened, paste your stream key and save
the file. Save this file in a safe place such as Desktop.

Now go to OBS, and go to the Stream tab. Paste your stream key and make sure
your livestreaming service is Twitch. After you have finished pasting your
stream key onto OBS, you should save your settings. Your OBS software is now
ready for streaming to Twitch.

* Start Streaming

Make sure that your OBS shows your intended application when streaming. What
pops up in the stream will be what your viewers see. You can add other effects
such as Text and GIFs to spice up the stream. You can also add post-processing
effects to enhance the quality of your stream.

When you are satisfied with the quality of your stream, click "Start Streaming"
and you will have successfully started a livestream on Twitch! Good luck on your
journey to becoming the next top Twitch streamer.
