If you are a gamer, you might have heard of the term /live streaming/. Live
streams broadcasts video over the internet, and some live-streamers broadcast
themselves playing video games. /[[https://twitch.tv/][Twitch]]/ is a live-streaming platform where
broadcasters can broadcast themselves playing video games or watching movies.

Live-streaming allows you to play your favorite video games, develop a fan base,
form parasocial relationships, and earn money. For some people, it is a fun and
unique way to show off their skills and reactions to the game. It can also be a
way to make friends and network with other gamers. It can be a way to take a
break from school or work, and just have some fun. It sounds like a win-win,
right?

Twitch has seen a massive growth during the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic. If you
are currently a live-streamer, you are more likely to succeed and grow your
audience.

Here, we list five games you can stream on Twitch that are enjoyable for you and
your audience and will boost your live-streaming career.
